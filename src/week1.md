# Week 1

This week's topic is an overview of what cryptography is about as well as our first example ciphers. You will learn about pseudo-randomness and how to use it for encryption. We will also look at a few basic definitions of secure encryption.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how stream ciphers work and how to use them correctly.
